            <h3>The birth of Atonal Records</h3>

            Established in 2014 by Aphiwe Magama in South Africa. Atonal Records has an exciting roster of artists on the rise. We sign and release high quality recordings by artists from around the world. Every recording is a classic on its own, with a story to tell. In fact Atonal Records do more than just signing and releasing high quality recordings; we assist with strategic partnership (provide services to other labels), release planning (artwork, mixing, mastering), profile construction etc
